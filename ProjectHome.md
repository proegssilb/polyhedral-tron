This is a 3D game concept written in Python with Panda3D. Inspired my a certain game featuring wall-spawning motorcycles, Polyhedral Tron extends the grid by projecting it on the inside of a 3D shape. The game sounds simple, but keeping track of where the walls are is much harder.

Required Disclaimer:
This is unpolished code. While it might run and might work, it may also not work, destroy parts of your system, and I do not know what else.

Requirements:
  * Panda3D (latest version should be fine, but no guarantees)
    * Panda3D comes with its own version of Python on Windows. If you run linux, get Python 2.5 or 2.6. Updating this project to 3.x is unlikely.
